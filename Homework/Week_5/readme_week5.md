# explanation for later added files
Dear TA, 

In order to clarify why there are certain changes after the deadline, here follows an explanation: 
 I added my name to the earlier files in order to ensure clarity. 

Then, about the Timeline_v2.html and Timeline_v2.js:
 I found out this morning that my graph should be able to portray multiple lines at once. 
 Unfortunately, I did not manage to implement this option before the deadline. That is entirely on me. 
 Obviously, I would appreciate it if you take a look at the v2 files, even though they are handed in after the deadline. 
 However, I completely understand it if you want to correct the earlier file that was handed in before the deadline. 
 This file will only showcase a sinlge line at once, whereas v2 shows multiple.
