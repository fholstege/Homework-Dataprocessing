## A remark and a question

E-Mailed help.mprog with a question, but did not get an answer. 

I asked whether or not the csv file should be loaded from the webpage of KNMI, or locally from a directory. 
I tried the latter for the past two days and did not succeed, as you will find out. 
I suspect that rather we should have done the former, so directly from the KNMI page. 
Would like feedback on how to perform this action.
